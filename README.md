# Ches

A small little game I'm making

## Dev

### Start

```bash
yarn  # might be needed
yarn dev
```

### Debug

`chess` is available in the browser console. Just type it. You'll be pleasantly surprised.

### Typecheck and lint

```bash
yarn check
```

### Generating sample games

Useful to check that a refactoring didn't change anything (the engine is deterministic right now).

```bash
yarn sample-games
```
